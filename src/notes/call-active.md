The user's webcam is shown in the bottom right, floating above the video of the other party's video stream.

#Variations
In the scenario where only one user is sending video, the avatr of the audio-only user should be shown in the same size and placement as the video stream would have been. If no avatar is available, the default 'Guest' avatar should be used.
